/* ================= PARSING DATA ==================
 
 - Due to the inconsistent formatting of the TAQ (Trade and Quote) data we have obtained, we will initally be processing the data as follows:

   Event types "QUOTE BID NB" and "QUOTE BID" will be treated the same. As will "QUOTE ASK NB" and "QUOTE ASK".

   We will ignore "TRADE" and "TRADE NB" event types because there is no information pertaining to which offers are being cleared when the trade takes place. In addition, the "TRADE" and "TRADE NB" rows are trades at a specific exchange. Since we are initially treating the entire file as one exchange, it doesn't make sense to process these offers. NOTE: it would be interesting to record all the trade informaiton as the data is being processed by the ECN and compare the trade results from our ECN to the trade tuples in the file.

 We will commence the ECN's functionality by simply using the insert_offer function to handle all offers in the file.
