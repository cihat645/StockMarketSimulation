// What does an OMS do?
//   - The order management system (OMS) places orders in a queue for processing, rebalances portfolios, documents orders and transaction history.

//It needs to take into consideration not only the price and quantity of shares, but also the type of order. It also needs to take into consideration the possibility and likelyhood of price improvement.

// It takes an order from one of the broker's clients as input and then makes a decision as to whether the order should be internalized, sent to an exchange or sent to an ECN.

/*
 Function Descriptions:
 
 1. update_orders - this function makes the appropritate changes to orders in the pending orders after the OMS has received relevant order_info pertaining to the filling of that order. A concrete example will help elucidate the purpose of this function. Say an ECN was able to fill 500 of the 1000 shares for a buy limit order due to the entered price and current market conditions (current market price, volume, etc.). The ECN will then add the limit order to current_bids and it will stay there until filled or the term of the order is violated (e.g. end of day for an order with an order term = Day). Right after adding the limit order to current_bids, the ECN which partially filled this order sends an order_info object to the OMS which includes the number of shares that were filled (500) and the average price obtained for those shares. The update_order function of the OMS then uses this information to adjust the average fill price and number of shares filled for the order in the pending_orders vector. Once the rest of the order has been filled (the order_info object would then have a status of 'Filled'), the order is removed from the pending_orders and added to the DBMS.
