// ================================================== ABOUT THE OMS ======================================================================

// The OMS must compute the benefits of internalizing the order (if feasible) vs. sending it to an ECN or market maker. This means the OMS needs to contemplate the trade-off between capital gain via internalization vs discovering optimal ECN routing method. It must also do so in compliance with SEC regulations. Market makers (and OTC market makers) incentivize brokers to route orders to them by offering a form of payment, called "Payment for order flow". We will not be incorporating this into the model as of now.

// As stated on the SEC website: In deciding how to execute orders, your broker has a duty to seek the best execution that is reasonably available for its customers' orders. That means your broker must evaluate the orders it receives from all customers in the aggregate and periodically assess which competing markets, market makers, or ECNs offer the most favorable terms of execution.

// When a broker scans the market in search of better execution prices, they are effectively looking for the "opportunity of price improvement". "Price improvement" is the opportunity, but not the guarantee, for an order to be executed at a better price than the current quote. (I'm assuming the current quote is the price of the latest trade).

// This function will process the front-most order in the queue, which consists of converting the order in to an offer and then sending that to either the ECN or internalizing the offer.

/*  Three potential choices for routing:
    1) ECN
    2) Broker's Inventory (internalize order)
    3) Match order with order from another client
 */

 Update_Order_Table() Documentation:
 1.  Why we had to create a new table for short positions.
 -Problem with the way in which we store short positions: if we store short positions in ContainsStock table with negative quantities, then we will need multiple tuples for one account if we want to have a long and a short position concurrently. However, this will not work since (AccountNo, Ticker) = Primary Key

/*
 1. Logic of Internalization:
     Consider the scenario where we own 500 shares of IBM which we obtained for $100 / share. Suppose we want to sell these shares whenever we, the broker, can do so at a profit (for internalization purposes).

     The DBMS table "Stock Inventory" contains the shares of stocks the broker is willing to internalize for a profit as well as the price that was paid to obtain those shares. The OMS takes this information into consideration and will determine if it is both profitable and possible to internalize the order.

     Situation: An incoming buy (limit) order is being processed with a qty of 1000 shares and a price of $110 share. The best market price at the moment is $110.05.

     - this will also internalize offers which have a buy (market) order where the price paid (in inventory) is less than the market price. Then we will fill them at $0.01 below the current best price in the market.

     The OMS will assess the situation as follows:
     - we are willing to sell 500 of our shares to the client who has placed this order because we will earn a profit of 500 * 110 = $55000 AND this provides a better price for those 500 shares than what is available currently in the market. (If this was a market order, the OMS will buy them for $110.04 because we are no longer bound to the constraint of providing a price better than or equal to the price specified by a limit order)

     - Given this, the OMS will fill 500 shares of the order at $110/share using the shares in the broker_inventory. Then it will reduce the quantity of shares in the broker inventory via a SQL query.

     - After filling all or part of the order via internalization, we will need to update_pending_orders() given the order_info that results from this internalization

     - The OMS then checks if any shares are remaining in the order (there are 500 remaining in this case) and will route the order to an ECN for fulfillment.

     - After the order has been filled at the ECN w/ best market price, we will update the pending_orders()

 2. internal_inventory.first = price paid for security by my_broker (obtained from DBMS)
    internal_inventory.second = qty of inventory the broker is willing to internalize (which is obtained from DBMS as well)

 3. Note: right now, we are only internalizing incoming Bids by comparing them to our inventory. In order to determine if we can internalize an incoming Ask we will need to assess all other orders to be processed by the OMS and determine if it is advantageous to buy the shares off the client. Other methods of determining whether to internalize an incoming sell order are beyond the scope of this project.

 4. This function answers the question: is internalizing the order viable given the responsibility of providing the best possible price? It is incumbent on the stock broker to provide the best possible price for a security given current market conditions, so we can only internalize if we meet these constraints.
